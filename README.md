5. NASA's ARSET Training
          * ARSET - [Satellite Remote Sensing for Agricultural Applications](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training?program_area=16&languages=All&source=All)
          
     * Agricultural Data Visualizations/Portal
          * [Agrometeorological (AGMET) Earth Observations (EO) Indicators](https://cropmonitor.org/tools/agmet/) The Agrometeorological (AGMET) Earth Observations (EO) Indicators bring together a variety of Earth Observation (EO) data products on the sub-national scale, each of which provides valuable insights on in-season crop development and current crop conditions. Combined, the different EO data plots help tell the story of in-season crop conditions through the use of different climate, environmental, and vegetative variables
          * [Global Agriculture Monitoring System (GLAM)](https://glam.nasaharvest.org/)The Global Agriculture Monitoring System (GLAM) is a web-based platform to enable near-real-time monitoring of global croplands, primarily using NASA MODIS satellite data. After years of operational use and valuable feedback from partners, it was time to redesign this system to be faster, more flexible, and to capitalize new datasets coming online and new computing architectures available.
          * [OpenET](https://openetdata.org/) OpenET uses best available science to provide easily accessible satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) for improved water management across the western United States. Using the Data Explorer, users can explore ET data at the field scale for millions of individual fields or at the original quarter-acre resolution of the satellite data.
          * [Crop Monitor Open](https://cropmonitor.org/index.php/cmreports/amis-report/), timely, and science-driven information on crop conditions in support of market transparency and early warning of production shortfalls.
          * [Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics (Crop-CASMA)](https://nassgeo.csiss.gmu.edu/CropCASMA/)is a web-based geospatial application. It is designed to remotely sense geospatial soil moisture and vegetation index data derived from NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) missions to assess U.S. soil moisture condition and crop vegetation conditions.
